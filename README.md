# 🏗️ E-commerce System Architecture — Learning + Development Journey

This repo is the **control center** for my full-stack learning and architecture journey, centered around building an enterprise-style **E-commerce System**.  
It links together backend, frontend (iOS + Web), and documentation repos.

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Learn full-stack development (backend, frontend web, iOS, DevOps).
- Practice **system design & architecture** for enterprise-scale apps.
- Build a portfolio that demonstrates my capability as a **Senior/Architect**.

## 🛠️ Learning Roadmap

### 1. System Design & Architecture

- Requirements gathering
- Monolith → Microservices journey
- DB schema design & evolution
- Caching, scaling, infra (AWS, Docker, CI/CD)
- Diagrams → C4 model (Context, Container, Component, Code)

### 2. Backend Development

- REST APIs with Node.js/Express
- Authentication (JWT, OAuth)
- Payment integration
- CI/CD pipelines
- Deployment (Docker + AWS)

### 3. iOS App (Swift / SwiftUI)

- UIKit refresher
- MVVM + Coordinators → TCA later
- API integration with backend
- Apple Pay & Stripe
- Unit/UI testing

### 4. Web Frontend (React / TypeScript)

- Core React patterns
- State management (Redux/React Query)
- UI/UX design
- Integration with backend APIs
- Deployment (Vercel/Netlify)

### 5. Documentation & Portfolio

- GitHub as source of truth
- High-level & low-level design docs
- System design case studies
- Blog posts & learnings
- Portfolio site (Next.js or GitHub Pages)

---

## 📖 Documentation Strategy

- Every repo has a `docs/` folder with:
  - **HLD** (system overview, diagrams, APIs)
  - **LLD** (DB schema, class diagrams, API contracts)
  - **Evolution notes** (decisions, trade-offs, migration steps)
- This repo (`ecommerce-system-architecture`) contains:
  - Cross-links to all repos
  - Architecture evolution log
  - System design case studies
  - Deployment & infra notes

---

## 📅 Progress & Milestones

- [ ] Phase 1 → Define base requirements & initial DB schema
- [ ] Phase 2 → Monolith backend MVP
- [ ] Phase 3 → iOS & Web clients (basic features)
- [ ] Phase 4 → Infra setup (CI/CD, AWS, Docker)
- [ ] Phase 5 → Microservices refactor
- [ ] Phase 6 → Portfolio site + case studies

## ✍️ Blog/Case Study Ideas

- Designing the DB schema for an e-commerce system
- Migrating from Monolith to Microservices
- Bridging UIKit and SwiftUI in enterprise apps
- End-to-end CI/CD with GitHub Actions, Docker, and AWS
